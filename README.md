# statsHouse

Turning home (energy) stats into house music mechanically: sonification.

Converting homogeneous and heterogeneous (CSV) data sets into MIDI.

The aim is to have at least three levels of 'production':
   * none: the data is sonified as plainly as possible
   * gentle: some gentle percussion and other musical effects added
   * house: aiming to sound like a grown-up house track

Adding samples and supercollider treatment is in scope.

Creating audio samples [direct from data values](https://www.earth.org.uk/statscast-202005.html) is also in scope.
