Items TO DO in some way, and nice-to-haves
==========================================


2023-07-08 DM from A8:

  * ... put a mastering plugin on it though. Even if it's just a basic limiter.


2023-06-13 thoughts:

  * Possible processing stages:
      * Parse/collect generation parameters.
      * Align (ls part of date to position in bar; may involve inserting nulls/padding)
      * Populate with basic notes from data.
      * Extend to full bars, phrases, sections.
      * Add filler notes on data melody tracks.
      * Add decoration notes on data melody tracks.
      * Add dependent aux tracks such as pad notes.
      * Add independent aux tracks (though maybe changes at sections): percussion, bass.
      * Save as .csv/.mid/.wav/etc to stdout or file, or play.


2023-06-04 copied from a private TODO list:
  
  * Make mkaudio able to deal with some data gaps (such as at 2023-05-13).
  * Sonify hourly data (such as import profile) as 24/bar, 7 bars + one pause.
  * Notes:
    *** Add 'house' version without intro using V1.0 awk perc lib.
      * Generate test set of input data and expected outputs, and also listen to.
      * Consolidation preprocessor (upstream of sonfication) to insert blanks for missing dates, initially obvious ones at points where least significant part of date does not simply increment.
      * Normalise to kWh/d figure for M data and maybe Y data, maybe allowing for missing data points.
    *** Do daily boost vs divert Thermino (left vs right, flute vs oboe) over year.
    *** Add (het) comparisons to energy series, eg ^^^ and imp/exp, etc.
      * Interleave M and Y data as verse and chorus; repeat chorus fragments as needed until 'verse' material exhausted.
      * Automatically (gently) ramp up the tempo with the (running, windowed) mean of the main variable?
      * Play multi-track kWh data as a chord, ie offset.
      * On D data tracks add 7d rolling average quietly...
      * On M data tracks add 3m rolling average quietly...
      * Play moving (eg 24h, 7d) means as bass or organ.
      * Play cycle-delayed (eg 1d, 1w, 1y) quietly in a different voice.
      * Insert counterpoint etc eg at 8th note after 1w cycle, days 29-31 on m.
      * Insert hiss/noise based on autocorr/variance (rolling mean / over 4 bars).
      * Use load profiles (of house, appliances) to drive bass.
      * Introduce breakdown and mini-breakdown.
      * Change bass instrument on phase boundaries or in breakdown.
      * DE: adjust filter cut off and resonance.
      * DE: supercollider audio coding.

      * C: produce in scales (8 per octave).
      * C: bass off-beat 4 per bar 1 octave below lowest/root.  Sharpish attack.
      * C: pad with common notes from current 4 bars...
      * C: ramp the cutoff filter (w/ main channel rolling mean?)
      * Try MAX: https://cycling74.com/products/max
