Items TO DO in some way, and nice-to-haves
==========================================

Entries should be deleted when substantially implemented.


Current priorities:
  * Alignment (more validation) and consider omitting partial bars for Danceable.
  * Improved (eg more robust, wider range, more representative) chorus bar synthesis.
  * Work in some progression especially for repeat verse/chorus.
  * Seeding/variations...


2023-07 thoughts:

  * A8: in response to V5.1.0 imp-M dc sample: "... put a mastering plugin on it though. Even if it's just a basic limiter."
  * Seeding and extra generation params / hints (eg cycle on W not M for daily data, use date range).
  * Turn up lead "brightness" (CC 71/74?) at end of verse leading into chorus?
  * For some cadences, have notes transition rather than be abrupt, using MIDI CC (legato?).
  * Make the tune progress, especially on repeated verse/chorus.
  * Consider building combo mix of multiple files, eg with alternating cadences.
  * Do better with -ve values in all styles.

  * Possible processing stages:
      * Align (ls part of date to position in bar; may involve inserting nulls/padding)
      * Extend to full bars, phrases, sections.
      * Add filler notes on data melody tracks.
      * Add decoration notes on data melody tracks.
      * Add dependent aux tracks such as pad notes.


2023-06-04 copied from a private TODO list:
  
  * Sonify hourly data (such as import profile) as 24/bar, 7 bars + one pause.
  * Notes:
      * Normalise to kWh/d figure for M data and maybe Y data, maybe allowing for missing data points.
    *** Do daily boost vs divert Thermino (left vs right, flute vs oboe) over year.
    *** Add (het) comparisons to energy series, eg ^^^ and imp/exp, etc.
      * Interleave M and Y data as verse and chorus; repeat chorus fragments as needed until 'verse' material exhausted.
      * Automatically (gently) ramp up the tempo with the (running, windowed) mean of the main variable?
      * Play multi-track kWh data as a chord, ie offset.
      * On D data tracks add 7d rolling average quietly...
      * On M data tracks add 3m rolling average quietly...
      * Play moving (eg 24h, 7d) means as bass or organ.
      * Play cycle-delayed (eg 1d, 1w, 1y) quietly in a different voice.
      * Insert counterpoint etc eg at 8th note after 1w cycle, days 29-31 on m.
      * Insert hiss/noise based on autocorr/variance (rolling mean / over 4 bars).
      * Use load profiles (of house, appliances) to drive bass.
      * Introduce breakdown and mini-breakdown.
      * Change bass instrument on phase boundaries or in breakdown.
      * DE: adjust filter cut off and resonance.
      * DE: supercollider audio coding.

      * C: bass off-beat 4 per bar 1 octave below lowest/root.  Sharpish attack.
      * C: pad with common notes from current 4 bars...
      * C: ramp the cutoff filter (w/ main channel rolling mean?)
      * A8: Try MAX: https://cycling74.com/products/max
